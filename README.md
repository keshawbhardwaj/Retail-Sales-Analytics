🚀 Excited to share my latest project completed using Power BI! I recently dove into Retail Sales Analytics, leveraging Power BI Desktop to analyze a dataset from Kaggle. 🛍️  

📊 Highlights include: 
- Creating KPIs like Total Sales 💲, Products Sold 📦, and Number of Orders 📑 to gauge overall performance.
- - Visualizing Total Revenue Trend over time 📈 using a line graph with Year and Quarter dimensions. -
  - Analyzing Total Revenue and Average Discount Percent trends 📉 using an area graph for better sales pattern understanding.
  - - Utilizing a Sunburst graph ☀️ to visualize Total Revenue distribution by Payment Type across different years.
    - - Implementing a Tree Map 🌳 to display Total Revenue by Product Type for easy comparison of top-performing categories.
